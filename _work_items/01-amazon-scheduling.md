	<div>
		<p>In 2018 Amazon launched a last-mile delivery program powered by entrepreneurs. These new companies needed a way to manage their drivers' schedule, record time-off and call-off requests, and communicate with Amazon both their capacity and drivers' names for routing purposes.</p>
		<p>The project was slow moving and complicated. The needs of each user (Amazon, the manager, and the driver) were often at odds with one another, forcing the team&mdash;consisting mainly of a Product Manager and myself&mdash;to make many compromises. We started by developing a vision for the product using Google Design Sprints as a framework. We established a baseline of solutions that consisted of a Weekly, Daily, and Default schedule for a Manager to use, and a Driver facing app for receiving the schedule and trading shifts (among other features).</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>In order to define our users and their needs for this tool, a Product Manager and I traveled to different delivery stations to observe users (painfully) completing dispatching tasks. We also had meetings with Amazon operations teams to understand their needs and then developed a timeline and scope for the project. I wireframed a handful of ideas, and, along with the Product Manager, decided on a design approach to move forward with. I then took these wireframes to a local delivery station to test my assumptions and get feedback.</p>

		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		<p>The final tool allows dispatchers to see where routes are, where drivers are, and quickly spot and triage exceptions. This enables 3rd-party companies to establish and more fully optimize their operations. The final designs were taken to a delivery station and presented to users for further feedback some of which was implemented and some was added to a future feature list.</p>
