		<p>In June of 2018 I was selected to join a growth team at Tech for Campaigns, an organization that assigns tech volunteers to teams and pairs them with local, state, and national campaigns in need of tech-related help. Our team, consisting of myself as UX designer, a Developer, a Social Marketing Manager, and a Product Manager were tasked with growing the database of volunteers.</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3">Wireframes Phase One</h2>
		<p>After an introductory meeting, I went through the Tech for Campaigns website and sign-up flow and outlined problems and opportunities that likely affected volunteer sign-up completion. I wrote a sentence or two describing my findings and initial thoughts on solving them and presented these during a brainstorming session. We then established a goal to significantly increase Tech for Campaigns' form completion percentage.</p>
		<p>The team decided to split the project into two phases and test along the way. The first phase was auditing for and removing unused form fields. I then repositioned the fields on the large form in a more organized, thoughtful way grouping related fields and sectioning them off from others. The second phase involved moving to a form-wizard and adding design elements that spark interest and assist completion.</p>
		<p>I wireframed the first phase and got approval from the founders. I then moved into Photoshop/Sketch and, in the case of the sign-up form, began making changes to the production site.</p>
		<p>The amount of space dedicated to branding elements was disproportionate to the goals of the organization which distracted visitors from signing up and buried vital content that explained how the process worked. The link to the volunteer form, the most important link on the site, was getting lost within the rest of the navigation. The sign-up form asked a few questions that weren't being used by the org and looked unnecessarily long and daunting.</p>
		<p>On top of design tweaks, we added an email only sign-up form to allow non-tech visitors to receive organization updates via email. This created a database of visitors that could be vetted and, in some cases with the right work experience, converted into volunteers. It also created a pool of non-tech volunteers that could be used for more traditional campaigning or fundraising.</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3">Final Design Phase One</h2>
		<p>After getting approval of the wireframes and basic design direction I moved into Photoshop and Sketch to explore designs and ideas further. We settled on a final design for approval and implementation. We tested the new design and found a 13% increase in volunteer form submissions. We also added a significant amount of email-only users that will hopefully convert to volunteers in the future.</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3">Wireframes Phase Two</h2>
		<p>After implemention and testing of phase one completed, work began on transforming the one page form into a multi-step wizard. Our assumption was by grouping related fields and ordering steps sequentially we'd reduce cognitive load and increase conversion.</p>
		<p>I thoughtfully split the form into four steps, designed a status bar, and added placeholders for intro text and icons. After a round of feedback from my team I saught approval from Tech for Campaigns' founders and moved into the final design phase.</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3">Final Design Phase Two</h2>
		<p>I sent the wireframes to the Tech for Campaign's Marketing Team for title and helper text to be placed at the top of each step. After a few rounds of back-and-forth the team agreed on a set of icons I pitched. I rebuilt them in Illustrator and Sketch and added Tech for Campaigns' red and blue colors. While completing this work, the developer on the team built out the step-based form in Drupal. Once complete, I wrote the CSS needed to match my design and added the icons in SVG form. The team tested the form thouroughly and we launched.</p>
		<p>We're currently monitoring success metrics to ensure conversion increase and continue improving conversion. So far we've increased volunteer sign-ups over unique homepage visitors from 8% to 33% - a huge success!</p>
