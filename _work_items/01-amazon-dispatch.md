	<div>
		<p>Among Amazon's many delivery solutions is a network of small, 3rd-party courier companies delivering from Amazon branded vans to customers' doors. Amazon needed a tool to collect daily rosters from these companies as well as provide their dispatchers and managers with driver location, driver progress, route information, and stop information. Currently dispatchers must be on-site at a delivery station in order to complete dispatching tasks, and they are largely blind to the progress of their drivers and the location of all the stops on a driver's route. They also must use multiple different tools to get the small amount of information they do have access to.</p>
		<p>The Product Manager was new to Amazon's logistics and shipping space so my logistics expertise, business knowledge, and field observations were vital to defining all aspects of this tool. From receiving the project to launching in beta form, the project took 6 months and is being used by all Amazon 3rd-party dispatchers and managers across North America. The tool will launch to the rest of the world in early 2018.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>In order to define our users and their needs for this tool, a Product Manager and I traveled to a few different delivery stations to observe users (painfully) completing dispatching tasks. We had a few meetings with Amazon operations teams to understand their needs and developed a rough timeline and scope for the project. I wireframed a handful of ideas, and, along with the Product Manager, decided on a design approach to move forward with. I then took these wireframes to a local delivery station to test my assumptions and get feedback.</p>

		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		<p>The final tool allows dispatchers to see where routes are, where drivers are, and quickly spot and triage exceptions. This enables 3rd-party companies to establish and more fully optimize their operations. The final designs were taken to a delivery station and presented to users for further feedback. We also collected many additional, nice-to-have feature requests which were collected and added to a future-feature list.</p>
