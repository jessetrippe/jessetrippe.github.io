	<div>
		<p>Working with another designer and the client, I built this brochure and portfolio site that portrays ARCH Consultants Ltd.'s reliability, thoughtful planning, and deep understanding of project management. I was consulted on many of the user interface elements and built the site inside of a content management system. The project went so well that I've stayed on to help with maintenance and implement additional features.</p>
