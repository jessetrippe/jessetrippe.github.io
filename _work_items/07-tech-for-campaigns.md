	<div>
		<p>In June of 2018 I was selected to join a growth team at Tech for Campaigns, an organization that assigns tech volunteers to teams and pairs them with local, state, and national campaigns in need of tech-related help. Our team, consisting of myself as UX designer, a Developer, a Social Marketing Manager, and a Product Manager were tasked with growing the database of volunteers.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes Phase One</h2>
		<p>After an introductory meeting, I went through the Tech for Campaigns website and sign-up flow and outlined problems and opportunities that likely affected volunteer sign-ups. I wrote a sentence or two describing how we could solve each of these and shared these during a brainstorming session. The first phase of changes were simply auditing likely unused fields and laying out and ordering the fields in a more deliberate way. The second phase of changes involved moving to a wizard and adding design elements to spark interest and walk a user through it.</p>
		<p>The team decided to split the project into two phases and test along the way. Our goal was to significantly increase Tech for Campaigns' form completion percentage. I wireframed the first phase and got approval from the founders. I then moved into Photoshop/Sketch and, in the case of the sign-up form, began making changes to the production site.</p>
		<p>The amount of space dedicated to branding elements was disproportionate to the goals of the organization which distracted visitors from signing up and buried vital content that explained how the process worked. The link to the volunteer form, the most important link on the site, was getting lost within the rest of the navigation. The sign-up form asked a few questions that weren't being used by the org and looked unnecessarily long and daunting.</p>
		<p>On top of design tweaks, we decided to add email only sign-up to the site in order to allows non-tech users to stay up-to-date on the organization, start the volunteer sign-up process (as the submission success page is a version of the volunteer sign-up form), collects a database of people interested in volunteering that might help campaigns in the future, and expands their database of contacts to source from if the organization ever wanted to fund-raise.</p>

		<h2>Final Design Phase One</h2>
		<p>After getting approval of the wireframes and basic design direction I moved into Photoshop and Sketch to explore designs and ideas further. We settled on a final design for approval and implementation. We tested the new design and found a 13% increase in volunteer form submissions. We also added a significant amount of email-only users that will hopefully convert to volunteers in the future.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes Phase Two</h2>
		<p>After implemention and testing of phase one completed, work began on transforming the one page form into a multi-step wizard. Our assumption was by grouping related fields and ordering steps sequentially we'd reduce cognitive load and increase conversion.</p>
		<p>I thoughtfully split the form into four steps, designed a status bar, and added placeholders for intro text and icons. After a round of feedback from my team I saught approval from Tech for Campaigns' founders and moved into the final design phase.</p>

		<h2>Final Design Phase Two</h2>
		<p>I sent the wireframes to the Tech for Campaign's Marketing Team for title and helper text to be placed at the top of each step. After a few rounds of back-and-forth the team agreed on a set of icons I pitched. I rebuilt them in Illustrator and Sketch and added Tech for Campaigns' red and blue colors. While completing this work, the developer on the team built out the step-based form in Drupal. Once complete, I wrote the CSS needed to match my design and added the icons in SVG form. The team tested the form thouroughly and we launched. We're currently monitoring success metrics to ensure conversion increase and continue improving conversion.</p>
