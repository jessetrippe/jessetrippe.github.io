	<div>
		<p>In June of 2018 I was selected to join a growth team for at Tech for Campaigns, an organization that assigns tech volunteers to teams and pairs them with local, state, & national campaigns that need tech-related help. Our team, consisting of myself as UX designer, a Front-end Developer, a Social Marketing Manager, a and Product Manager were tasked with growing their database of volunteers.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>After an initial introductory meeting, I went through the entire Tech for Campaigns' website and sign-up flow and outlined problems and opportunities that likely affected sign-ups. I wrote a sentence or two describing how we could solve each of these and pitched during a team brainstorming session. I wireframed a handful of these ideas for approval from the founders and, after collecting some feedback and getting the go-ahead, I moved into Photoshop/Sketch and, in the case of the sign-up form, began making changes to the production site.</p>
		<p>The amount of space dedicated to branding elements was disproportionate to the goals of the org, deemphasized signing up, and buried content that explained how the process worked. Users were asked to scroll past a large branding graphic and navigation in order to get to an explanation of the organization and the volunteer process. The link to the volunteer form, probably the most important link on the site, was getting lost within the rest of the navigation. The sign-up form asked a few questions that weren't being used by the org and looked unecessarily long.</p>
		<p>On top of design tweaks, we decided to add email only sign-up to the site. This allows non-tech users to stay up to date on what the organization is up to, it also starts the sign-up process as the submmission success page is a version of the volunteer sign-up form, it collects a database of users interested in volunteering that might help for campaigns in the future, and, if the org ever wanted to fundraise, it expands their database of contacts to source from.</p>

		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		<p>After getting approval of the wireframes and basic design direction I moved into Photoshop and Sketch to explore designs and ideas further and finally piece together a final design for approval and implementation. We're currently A/B testing the new design verse the old so see how much it improves conversion.</p>
