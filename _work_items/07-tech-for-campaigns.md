	<div>
		<p>In June of 2018 I was selected to join a growth team at Tech for Campaigns, an organization that assigns tech volunteers to teams and pairs them with local, state, & national campaigns in need of tech-related help. Our team, consisting of myself as UX designer, a Front-end Developer, a Social Marketing Manager, and a Product Manager were tasked with growing their database of volunteers.</p>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>After an introductory meeting, I went through the entire Tech for Campaigns' website and sign-up flow and outlined problems and opportunities that likely affected volunteer sign-ups. I wrote a sentence or two describing how we could solve each of these and shared these during a brainstorming session. I wireframed the ideas we decided to proceed with and got approval from the founders. I then moved into Photoshop/Sketch and, in the case of the sign-up form, began making changes to the production site.</p>
		<p>The amount of space dedicated to branding elements was disproportionate to the goals of the organization which distracted visitors from signing up and buried vital content that explained how the process worked. The link to the volunteer form, the most important link on the site, was getting lost within the rest of the navigation. The sign-up form asked a few questions that weren't being used by the org and looked unnecessarily long and daunting.</p>
		<p>On top of design tweaks, we decided to add email only sign-up to the site in order to allows non-tech users to stay up-to-date on the organization, start the volunteer sign-up process (as the submission success page is a version of the volunteer sign-up form), collects a database of people interested in volunteering that might help campaigns in the future, and expands their database of contacts to source from if the organization ever wanted to fund-raise.</p>

		<h2>Final Design</h2>
		<p>After getting approval of the wireframes and basic design direction I moved into Photoshop and Sketch to explore designs and ideas further. We settled on a final design for approval and implementation. We're currently A/B testing the new design to see how much it improves conversion.</p>
