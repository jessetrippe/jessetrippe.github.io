                    <div class="grid-cell 1/2">
                        Similar to the way you would track a package online, Coyote provides tracking information through the Coyote.com web app and mobile apps. Shippers need near up-to-the-minute information on where their shipments are. If carriers aren't providing this via our mobile app or website, representatives have to call drivers and update tracking notes, taking time away from booking new freight.

                    <div class="grid-cell 1/2">
                        About 20% of all loads were updated this way. Stakeholders predicted, with an improved experience and workflow for tracking loads, this could be doubled. This was given to me, a stakeholder, a business analyst, and a development team in Pune, Maharashtra, India to solve. Our solution was a homepage on the website where a user could see all of the outstanding tasks required of them by Coyote, and a way for them to fulfill these tasks quickly.

                <p>The paper and pen phase of this project was quick and used to explore a few solutions to the problem. The team met and decided on one design idea. Requirements gathering was easy as most of the tasks were already defined in other areas of the app. The hard part here was deciding when a task became important verse just available to complete.</p>

                <p>After putting together mockups of our solution and running user tests with carrier and the reps that manually track them, we quickly found a problem with our solution&mdash;while gathering all the tasks into one, easy to use interface solved half the problem, sending them to other areas of the site to actually complete the task slowed them down considerable. It was here that we decided to implement an actionable sidebar to complete each task without having to leave the page.</p>
                <p>In order to prove this, I built a prototype using Bootstrap and tested it. Users found it considerably easier to find required tasks, and complete required tasks.</p>

                <h2 class="cd-aside-title font-sm push-bottom">Production</h2>
                <p>Adding a sidebar to complete each tasks increased the effort to complete this project considerably. To help the business come to terms with this, we built the project in phases, allowing other projects and features to take priority in between the phases.</p>
                <p>With each phase released, the amount of loads tracked through the website increased significantly, eventually easily passing our 40% goal. Other parts of the business have seen this feature and are now develoing their own "My Tasks" pages to help solve similar manual processes.</p>
