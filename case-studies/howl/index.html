                        Along with Coyote's mobile team, a product manager, and various stakeholders, I designed and help build Coyote Howl. The app was built from start to finish in about 3 months, launching first internally to sales reps and later to external customers.

                        Howl's main purpose was twofold: first, to give shippers a tool to help manage and view their day-to-day freight; and secondly, to provide customer sales reps another tool in their aresenal to sell Coyote to potential customers.

                <p>Initial requirements asked for a standard, already established set of features (loads assigned to the user, filtering and searching loads by various reference numbers, Coyote representatives and their contact information, and notifications on a given load status changes (e.g. when a load has been delivered) as well something visually impressive and appealing to be highlighted during sales demonstrations. We originally focused on designing a new type of navigation to which would solve this request which would provide interactivity throughout the app.</p>
                <p>After minimal user testing where users overall found the navigation hard to use and not very discoverable, and talking through the problem more, we came to the conclusion that gambling on the navigation was too risky and instead would utilize what came to be know as the Visibility tab as a place to "wow" customers during sales pitches.</p>

                <p>After settling on most of the content, we built a prototype with the majority of the content and presented it to the stakeholders on the project. The prototype was mostly slides with very little interactivity. This was used to make sure all parties (user stakeholders, sales stakeholders, development team, and the design team) involved were aware of the content and functionality being asked for and built.</p>
                <p>While the development team started building out the backend services and the framework in Ionic and AngularJS, I built a working prototype with actual content and started testing it with users. Eventually this code was merged with the development team's framework, as it was also built on Ionic, and is now in the production version of the app. During this round of user testing I discovered, among other things, that our menus were way too deep for external customer users and vital load information was far too many taps away for it to be useful. I modified the prototype and final design to feature contact information and primary load information directly on the load details screen.</p>

                <p>The final app features Coyote's signature green along with bright charts, graphs, and maps. It features a familiar, easily discoverable menu and each section of the app has been simplified to eliminate unnecessary depth in the navigation.</p>
