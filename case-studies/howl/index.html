                        Along with Coyote's mobile team, a Product Manager, and a Stakeholder, I designed and help build Coyote Howl. The app was built from start to finish in about 3 months, launching first internally to sales reps and later externally to customers.

                    <div class="grid-cell 1/2">
                        Howl's purpose was twofold: first, to give shippers a tool to help manage and view their day-to-day freight; and secondly, to provide customer sales reps with a tool to help sell Coyote to potential customers.

                <p>The requirements asked for an already established set of features (tracking information, filtering and searching of shipments, Coyote rep contact information, and notifications on shipment status changes (e.g. when a load has been delivered) as well as some aspect to that could be highlighted during sales demos. For the latter request we initially focused on a new type of navigation which would provide a fun interactive element throughout the app.</p>
                <p>After minimal user testing we found the navigation hard to use and not very discoverable. We talked through the problem more and came to the conclusion that gambling on the design of the navigation was too risky. Instead we built a new tab called Visibility to show larger trends of a customer's freight network. The charts and map on this page made for a great demo.</p>

                <p>I built mockups and presented it to the user stakeholders, sales stakeholders, and development team to make sure everyone was aware of the content and functionality being asked for and built.</p>
                <p>While the development team started building out the backend services and the framework in Ionic and AngularJS, I built a working prototype with actual content and started testing it with users. Eventually this code was merged with the development team's framework, as it was also built on Ionic, and is now in the production version of the app. During this round of user testing I discovered, among other things, that our menus were way too deep for external customer users and vital load information was far too many taps away for it to be useful. I modified the prototype and final design to feature contact information and primary load information directly on the load details screen.</p>

                <p>The final app features Coyote's signature green along with bright charts, graphs, and maps. It features a familiar, easily discoverable menu and each section of the app has been simplified to eliminate unnecessary depth in the navigation.</p>
