				<h3 class="push-half-top">To increase the amount of time Coyote reps spend booking new freight we needed to increase carrier self-tracking.</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>Coyote provides shippers with up-to-the-minute tracking information of their shipments through web and mobile apps. If carriers aren't providing this via our mobile app or website, representatives have to call drivers and update tracking notes manually, taking time away from booking new freight.</p>
				<p>Stakeholders predicted that an improved experience and workflow for updating loads could double self-tracking to 40%. This problem was given to me, a Stakeholder, a Business Analyst, and a development team in Pune, Maharashtra, India to solve. Our solution was a landing page where users are presented with outstanding tasks and a quick way for them to complete them.</p>

				<h2>Sketches</h2>
				<p>The paper and pen phase of this project was quick and used to explore a few solutions to the problem. The team met and decided on one design idea. Requirements gathering was easy as most of the tasks were already defined in other areas of the app. The hard part here was deciding when a task became important enough to warrant a spot on this page as there are many tasks required by any given carrier user on our website.</p>

				<h2>Wireframes</h2>
				<p>After putting together wireframes of our solution and running user tests with carrier and the reps that manually track them, we quickly found a problem with our solutionâ€”while gathering all the tasks into one, easy to use interface solved half the problem, sending them to other areas of the site to complete the task slowed them down. So we decided to implement an actionable sidebar to complete each task without having to leave this page.</p>

				<h2>Final Design</h2>
				<p>Adding an actionable sidebar increased the effort to complete this project considerably so we built the project in phases, allowing other projects and features to take priority in between.</p>
				<p>With the release of each phase, the amount of self-tracking increased, eventually surpassing our 40% goal. Other parts of the business have seen this feature and are now developing their own "My Tasks" pages to help solve similar problems.</p>
