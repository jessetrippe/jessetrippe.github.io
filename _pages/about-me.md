				<h3>Computer dork meets social butterfly. This unique personality of opposites allows me to successfully combine serious work skills while multi-tasking with style and ease. Combine the diplomacy of Madeline Albright with the humanitarian vision of President Jimmy Carter and add the flexibility of Spider-Man and you've&nbsp;got&nbsp;me.</h3>

				<p>You've heard it all beforeâ€”a young guy with small town Michigan roots moves to the big city to chase his dreams and mostly finds jobs stuffing envelopes and foaming lattes. So I hit the books and keyboard at <a href="http://www.saic.edu/" target="_blank">The School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a> for a BA in Fine Arts, and now I design and redesign in my sleep.</p>
				<p>I taught myself HTML &amp; CSS, applied my knowledge to front-end web design and fell in love with building websites. After years of freelance work and a brief period with the Obama Reelection Campaign, I joined Coyote Logistics in 2011 designing and building various online business tools. I'm now the Lead Product Designer, solving design and development problems on a massive online site and several mobile apps built for Coyote's shippers and carriers.</p>
