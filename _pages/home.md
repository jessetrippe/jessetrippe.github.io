				<h2>UI Design</h2>
				<p>I simplify interfaces by asking questions and analyzing every scenario. This often leads to fixing things earlier in the process thus avoiding adding unncessary complexicty. Other times it leads to implementing a design that fits perfectly with what the user hopes to accomplish.</p>

				<h2>UX Design</h2>
				<p>In order to deliver user experiences with as few barriers as possible, my design process usually involves pen and paper, online mockup tools, and user interviews and tests with the goal to fail fast and iterate. Once the flow has been decided I turn to Illustrator or Sketch for finishing touches.</p>

				<h2>Visual Design</h2>

				<h2>Development</h2>
				<p>Using current and modern standards, I take pixel-perfect designs and code them into working, full-fledged websites and apps that are highly accessible. My skillset includes HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and WordPress.</p>
