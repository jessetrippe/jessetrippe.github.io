intro-text: <p>I joined the Barack Obama Reelection Campaign as a Front-End Developer. My main responsibilities included the creation and maintenance of donation forms. This included front-end form validation, error handling, embedded video, mobile layout considerations, A/B testing and constant modifications and troubleshooting. I was also solely in charge of the development of Barack Obama's Tumblr blog which required learning Tumbr's templating language as well as defining mobile breakpoints and layouts.</p>
