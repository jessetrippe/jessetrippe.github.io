intro-text: <p>Deb Reinhart Interior Design Group Inc. needed an elegant site to showcase their work and easily update it. With provided Photoshop files, I coded it so that nearly every item on the elegant site can be updated by the client through a WordPress backend, including their interior design blog.</p>
