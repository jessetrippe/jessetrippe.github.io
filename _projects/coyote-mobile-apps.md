intro-text: <p>As Lead Product Designer for Coyote Logistics, I was in charge of designing an internal app used by employees to find information about shippers, carriers, and the freight they're trying to move as well as an external app used by shippers to find information about their freight and network. After numerous user interviews and researching similar apps in the marketplace, I designed the user interface and coded a front-end framework to implement the designs. This work was then built into PhoneGap to produce the final product.</p><p>Both apps have a similar look and feel and even share some features but the external app has a more streamlined user experience as it's trying to solve a smaller, more specific problem.</p>
